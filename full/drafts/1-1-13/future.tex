For each algorithm proposed in Chapter \ref{ch:reliable-mcast} -- \mdrs, \fls, \pcnts, \mfs, \mds, and \mc -- we plan to supplement its basic description with a detailed 
specification of the algorithm steps, implement the algorithm in OpenFlow, and evaluate its implementation.  We estimate this requires six months of steady work to complete.  
The author believes this six month goal will be met without issue as the birth and care of a newborn child -- the author expects his first born child in January 2013 --
should introduce no delays nor complications.
