\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:rollback-conclude}

In this chapter, we developed methods for recovery in scenarios where a malicious node injects false state into a distributed system.  
We studied an instance of this problem in distance vector routing.
We presented and evaluated three new algorithms for recovery in such scenarios. %from false state in distance vector routing 
Among our three algorithms, our results showed that \cpr -- a checkpoint-rollback based algorithm -- yields the lowest message and time overhead over topologies
with fixed link weights.  However, \cpr had storage overhead and required either loosely synchronized clocks or synchronization through logical clocks.
In the case of topologies where links weights can change, \purge performed best by avoiding the problems that plagued \cpr and \seconds.
Unlike \cprs, \purge has no stale state to update because \purge does not rollback in time.  
The \infinity problem resulted in high message overhead for \seconds, while \purge eliminated the \infinity problem by globally purging false state before finding new least cost paths.
