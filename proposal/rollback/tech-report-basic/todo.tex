{\bf Writing Todos}

{\it 
\begin{itemize}

	\item do all of our recovery algorithms requires loose synchronization assumption since the oracle notification includes time $t'$?

	\item if there is a \lcd then the node must send

\end{itemize}
}

{\bf Miscallaneous Text}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Although we only explicitly consider flat topologies, we believe that the recovery algorithms studied in this work can be applied to hierarchical topologies. 
	{\it this text was in the Problem Formulation section, at the end of the first paragraph}

\end{itemize}
