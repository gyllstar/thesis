\section{Formal Problem Statement and Notation}
\label{sec:problem}

We consider distance vector routing \cite{Gall87,Ford62} over arbitrary network topologies. We model a network as an undirected graph, $G=(V,E)$,
with a link weight function $w: E \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$.
{\footnote {\small Recovery is simple with link state routing: each node uses its complete topology map to compute new least cost paths that avoid all compromised nodes.
Thus we do not consider link state routing in this paper.}}
Each node, $v$, maintains the following state as part of distance vector: a vector of all adjacent nodes ($adj(v)$), a vector of least cost distances to all
nodes in $G$ (\minvvs), and a \emph{distance matrix} that contains distances to every node in the network via each adjacent node (\dmatrixvs). 

We make the following assumptions about the distance vector computation. All initial \dmatrix values are non-negative. Furthermore, all \minv values periodically
exchanged between neighboring nodes are non-negative. All $v \in V$ know their adjacent link costs. All link weights in $G$ are non-negative and do not change.
$G$ is finite and connected. Finally, we assume reliable communication. 

We assume that the identity of the compromised nodes -- which we refer to as $\overline{V}$ -- are provided by a different algorithm \cite{Arini,Feam,Vishal02,Pad03,Paul02}.
Specifically, we assume that at time $t_b$, this algorithm detects all compromised nodes and notifies the neighbors of each compromised node.  Let $t'$ be the time the first node was compromised.

For each algorithm, the goal is for all nodes to recover correctly: all nodes should remove all compromised nodes as a destination and find
new least cost distances that do not use a compromised node. If the network becomes disconnected as a result of removing the compromised nodes, all
nodes need only compute new least cost distances to all other nodes within their connected component.  With one exception, the input and output of each algorithm is the same. 
{\footnote {\small Additionally, as input \cpr requires that each $v \in adj($\bads$)$ is notified of the time, $t'$, in which \bad was compromised.}}
\begin{itemize}

	\item {\bf Input:}  Undirected graph, $G=(V,E)$, with weight function $w: E \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$.  $\forall v \in V$,  \minvv and \dmatrixv are computed
	(using distance vector). Also, each $v \in adj($\bads$)$ is notified that \bad was compromised.

	\item {\bf Output:} $G'=(V',E')$, where $V' = V - \overline{V}$, $E'=E - \{(\overline{v},v_i)$ $|$ $\overline{v} \in \overline{V} \wedge v_i \in adj(\overline{v}) \}$.
	%Undirected graph, $G'=(V',E')$, where $V' = V -\{$\bads$\}$, $E'=E - \{(\bar{v},v_i)$ $|$ $v_i \in adj(\bar{v}) \}$,
\end{itemize}
For convenience, $|V| = n$ and the diameter of $G'$ is $d$. Let $\displaystyle \max_{i \in V'}(|adj(i)|) = m$.  

For an arbitrary $\overline{v} \in \overline{V}$ we use the following notation. \oldvector refer to $\overrightarrow{min}_{\overline{v}}$ before \bad was compromised.
\badvector denotes $\overrightarrow{min}_{\overline{v}}$ after \bad has been compromised.
Intuitively, \oldvector and \badvector are snapshots of the compromised node's least cost vector taken at two different timesteps: \oldvector marks the snapshot taken before \bad was compromised and 
\badvector represents a snapshot taken after \bad was compromised.

Let $\delta_t(i,j)$ be the least cost between nodes $i$ and $j$ -- used by node $i$ --  at time $t$ (we refer to this cost as $\delta(i,j)$).
$p_t(i,j)$ refers to $i$'s actual least cost path to $j$ at time $t$.
 $p_s(i,j)$ is the least cost path from node $i$ to $j$ used by $i$ at $t_b$
and $\delta_s(i,j)$ is the cost of this path; $p_u(i,j)$ is $i$'s least cost path to $j$ at time $t \in [t_b,t^*]$ and $\delta_u(i,j)$ the cost of this path 
{\footnote {\small $p_u(i,j)$ and $\delta_u(i,j)$ can change during $[t_b,t^*]$.}}; and $p_f(i,j)$ is $i$'s final least cost path to $j$ (least cost at $t^*$)
 and has cost $\delta_f(i,j)$.  $\ell(i,j)$ is the minimum number of links between nodes $i$ and $j$ in $G'$.  


For each algorithm, let $t^*$ mark the time when the recovery algorithm completes. Let $\hat{t}$ be the time all diffusing computations complete.  Recall with \purges, \bad is removed as a destination and 
\badvector state is invalidated in the \emph{same} diffusing computations.   Likewise, each \cpr diffusing computation performs two actions: 
the diffusing computations remove \bad as a destination \emph{and} implement the rollback.  For this reason, $\hat{t}$ marks the same time across all three recovery algorithms. 
Let $C(i,j) = \delta_f(i,j) - \delta_{\hat{t}}(i,j)$.  That is, $C(i,j)$ refers to the magnitude of change in $\delta(i,j)$ after the diffusing computations for each algorithm complete.
