\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:pmu-conclude}

In this chapter, we formulated four PMU placement problems and proved that each one is NPC. 
Consequently, future work should focus on developing approximation algorithms for these problems.  As a first step, we presented two simple greedy algorithms:
{\tt xvgreedy} which considers cross-validation and {\tt greedy} which does not.  Both algorithms iteratively add PMUs to the node which observes the maximum of number of nodes. 

Using simulations, we found that our greedy algorithms consistently reached close-to-optimal performance.  
We also found that cross-validation had a limited effect on observability: for a fixed number of PMUs, {\tt xvgreedy} and {\tt xvoptimal} observed only $5\%$ fewer nodes than
{\tt greedy} and {\tt optimal}, respectively. As a result, we believe imposing the cross-validation requirement on PMU placements is advised, as the benefits they provide come at a low marginal cost.
