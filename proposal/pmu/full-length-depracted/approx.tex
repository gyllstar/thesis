\section{Approximation Algorithms}
\label{sec:approx}

Because \maxincs, \xvals, and \xvalpart are NP-Complete problems, we propose greedy approximation algorithms for each problem, which iteratively add 
a PMU in each step to the node which observes the maximum number of new nodes. 

{\bf \maxinc Greedy Algorithm}. We start with $\Phi = \emptyset$.  At each iteration, we add a PMU to the node that results in the observation of the maximum number of 
new nodes. The algorithm terminates when all PMUs are placed.  This is the same greedy algorithm proposed by Aazami and Stilp \cite{Aazami07}. 

{\bf \xval and \xvalpart Greedy Algorithm}. The greedy algorithm is almost identical to \maxincs's, except that PMUs are added in pairs such that the selected pair observe
the maximum number of nodes under the condition that the PMU pair satisfy one of the cross-validation rules. % and observe the maximum number of new nodes.




%\xvals's greedy algorithm can either:
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Add pairs of PMUs at each iteration such the selected pair of nodes observes the most nodes. both nodes need to be unobserved. pros/cons
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item ignores odd number of PMUs
%	\end{itemize}
%	\item Add a single PMU at each iteration so the PMU is cross-validated and observes the maximum nodes (among the cross-validated options). pros/cons
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item may be better to add PMUs in pairs
%
%		\item may restrict options by having to place nodes near each other ...
%	\end{itemize}
%
%\end{itemize}
